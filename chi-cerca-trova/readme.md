# chi-cerca-trova (kee chair-kah truh-vah)

small demo app for a minimal

built with streamlit.

Corpora are three cassics of Italian literature, widely studied at schoool:
- Divina Commedia di Dante Alighieri
- Promessi Sposi di Alessandro Manzoni
- Orlando Furioso di Ludovico Ariosto

Sources are taken from gutenberg project:
- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1012
- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45334
- https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3747
in the repo we have both a copy of original gutenberg txt file and a trimmed down version
for easier processing.

Each corpus is processed in chunks and every chunk has associated metadata.

"chi-cerca-trova" means "he who seeks shall find" in Italian.
