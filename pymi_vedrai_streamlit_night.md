**title**: Streamlit: example-driven learning for everyone

##### description

Streamlit is a Python Framework that makes creating Python powered data apps easy and fun.
If you have never heard about it, you will learn about a new way of having fun with Python
and how to deploy interactive applications for everyone to enjoy.
If you already have played with Streamlit, you might learn more on how to build complex apps and some advanced topics.
A bunch of different example apps covering data science use cases will be used to make learning more fun and effective.

##### bio

After 9 years as Data Scientist in Toolsgroup, a company that makes a software for Supply Chain Planning and Optimization,
Pietro is taking some time off and working to become a better programmer at Recurse Center.
In the last few years he has enjoyed building streamlit apps and teaching streamlit to colleagues.
He mistakenly believes that knowing a bit of streamlit makes him a frontend developer (luckily pythonistas are not inclined to prove him wrong).

##### description
Is there any chance today to build web apps if you only know Python?
We will see some real-case examples of how we can use Streamlit to build MVP products for end users.

By day, Fabio is a Python Software Engineer at Jobtome in Switzerland, specializing in building pipelines, APIs, and Machine Learning models; by night, he dives into exciting side projects, exploring the potentials of Streamlit and Machine Learning in various areas, from music to real estate.

- pushing streamlit to its limits
- e.g. replicate pomodoro timer (try to use components)
- e.g. tools I use online (dataframe converter)
- interested in only musical base of a song, they are paid
- Moseca: App of the month
  - show ideas behind
  - and more frontend
  - story about iOS app
- 3 ways on how to deploy
  - 0: on your PC
  - 1: streamlit cloud
  - 2: hugginface (more memory and compute)
  - 3: if you need GPU, go for colab
- building a site MVP in streamlit? example "How much can you earn on AirBnB?"
  - anchors and presentation
- testing of streamlit
  - (how to get stickers and shirts!)
